      <h2>My Appreciation for Mozart</h2>
      <p>
        I grew up listening to bollywood songs. But when I was in my late
        teenage years, I started learning guitar. I learnt guitar through
        Youtube videos. One day while I was watching some guitar playing videos
        on youtube, I was recommended Turkish March by Mozart. I listened to it,
        I felt like that it is taking me to a different journey of life. Then I
        started listening to Mozart Music on a daily basis. His compositions are
        not like millionare motivation, breakup, sad death but its more like
        real life. His music gives me mixture of feelings like rememberence of
        past, opening of new dimensions of life, something you've never thought.
        It makes me numb, sometimes and also suspicious.
